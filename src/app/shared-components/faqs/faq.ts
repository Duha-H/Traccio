    question: 'Why should I use Traccio?',
    // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
    answer: 'Traccio is a simple and intuitive organizational tool. Job hunts are a full-time job, that can sometimes be soul-draining, and may provide little immediate reward. Traccio helps make your job-search just a bit more tolerable, and provides you with the tools needed to stay motivated!',
    section: 'about',
  },
  {
    id: 'why-traccio2',
    question: 'How does Traccio help?',
    // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
    answer: 'An organized job search is a more effective one, and Traccio provides you with the tools to keep track of your applications in one place (No more sending out multiple applications to the same potential employer). It also helps you visualize how your job search is panning out; keep track of how frequently you\'re applying, and oversee how effective your search is by tracking how often you\'ve heard back.',

    // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
    answer: 'Absolutely! Traccio is an open-sourced web application, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/Duha-H/Traccio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">app\'s repository</a> or its <a href="https://github.com/Duha-H/Traccio/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki page</a> for more insight.',

    id: 'journeys',
    question: 'What\'s the point of Journeys?',
    // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
    answer: 'Journeys are meant to help you bundle applications sent out for different job-hunts. You were applying for internships last summer? That\'s a Journey! You want to separate and compare your search for your entry level position 3 years ago, and your current search for your next role? Those are two different Journeys! They\'re simply there to help you split different job-hunts and make your data-tracking more meaningful.',

  },
  {
    id: 'wishlist',
    question: 'What\'s the point of Wishlist Applications?',
    // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
    answer: 'Wishlist applications are applications you plan to send out in the future but haven\'t submitted yet. They simply allow you to pre-emptively track them, and add them to any Journey at a later date. In the future, Traccio might allow you to set deadlines for Wishlist Applications, and send you reminders to apply!',

    id: 'dashboard',
    question: 'What can I learn from my Dashboard?',
    // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
    answer: 'Your Dashboard is Traccio\'s heart and soul:<br>\
      &#8226; &nbsp; It\'s a stats-hub for any given Journey: it provides you with details about how often you\'re applying. Say you want to set an application quota for a given week, and keep track of whether or not you met that quota? Your Dashboard is here to save the day! <br>\
      &#8226; &nbsp; It also helps you visualize a breakdown of how effective your job-hunt potentially is, by distilling the status of different applications you sent out. <br>\
      &#8226; &nbsp; It gives you a productivity calendar; hopefully a more colorful Calendar is a decent motivator for you to keep going! <br>\
      (p.s. all those neat-o data-visualization components? They\'re courtesy of <a href="https://nivo.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nivo âœ¨</a> and you should check it out)',

  {
    id: 'search',
    question: 'What exactly does the "Search" functionality search through?',
    // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
    answer: 'The "Search" functionality helps you search through Journeys, submitted applications, and Wishlist applications. It\'s simply there so you can quickly find out if you\'ve submitted an application already, so you can avoid re-submitting it, or re-applying before a specific buffer period at a given company.',

    question: 'Is Traccio going to include paid features at any point?',
    // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
    answer: 'Traccio is currently a one (wo)man shop, so as the user-base grows some cool new (potentially) paid features might be added to offset the costs of application-hosting and user-storage. Not to worry though, for users joining now (as in if you can read this message with no indicated updates to it, and you\'re currently signed up, you are one of those users), Traccio will continue to provide its core set of features for free (no switching to a subscription-based model or anything like that). That being said, <a href="https://paypal.me/traccioapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tips</a> are most appreciated and welcome! :)',

    // tslint:disable-next-line: max-line-length
    answer: 'Funny story! (it\'s actually not that funny at all) The app was originally called Tracker (as in job-search tracker) in development, but try to get <i>tracker.app</i> or <i>tracker-app.com</i> as your domain for cheap (trick question, you can\'t!). So Trac<i>cio</i> was a close-enough, neat-sounding alternative (with an available domain!) that came to <a href="https://github.com/Duha-H/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">me</a> in a daydream.',
