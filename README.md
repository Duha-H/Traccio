What is *Traccio*?
===

*Traccio* is a simple job hunt tracking application. It allows users to organize their job search endeavors, log in job applications they've submitted, and conveniently track them. It also helps users better monitor their progress, and distill different trends in their job hunts.

  *nivo* is a data-visualization *Reactjs* library, so I had to jump through *some* hoops to use this library in my *Angular* app, but it was one of the main inspirations behind the idea for this app, so I couldn't really compomise on using it.
